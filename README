===================
My Server Playbooks
===================

These are the Ansible playbooks I use for setting up my servers. I use FreeBSD
on them exclusively, so they may be of limited utility to people using other
OSs.

Use
===

Initial setup of a fresh machine can be done with `bootstrap.yml`. This
ensures that Python and sudo are installed on the target machine and ensures
that users in the `wheel` group don't need to provide a password when using
sudo. Run this with::

    make bootstrap

Once all hosts have been bootstrapped, you can run the rest of the main
playbooks with::

    make

This runs all the playbooks listed in `site.yml`.

Nameserver role
===============

This role just does basic setup needed for both primary and secondary
nameservers. The actual heavy lifting is in a seperate repo which contains the
zonefiles.
