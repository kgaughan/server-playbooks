My Server Playbooks
===================

These are the Ansible playbooks I use for setting up my servers. I use FreeBSD
on them exclusively, so they may be of limited utility to people using other
OSs.

Use

Initial setup of a fresh machine can be done with `bootstrap.yml`. This
ensures that Python and sudo are installed on the target machine and ensures
that users in the `wheel` group don't need to provide a password when using
sudo. Run this with::

    make bootstrap

Once all hosts have been bootstrapped, you can run the rest of the main
playbooks with::

    make

This runs all the playbooks listed in `site.yml`.

Not currently covered
=====================

Some small amount of additional setup is required when you initially configure
SSH keys. This is mainly because I set up my keys before I wrote the bootstrap
playbook. This wouldn't be difficult to fix: the authorized_key_ module
exists for just this.
