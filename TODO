Playbook
========

* It would be nice to have a role for deploying an OAuth server.

* A nice to have would be a *secondary MX*.

* Add a wireguard__ role. This would give me a VPN between my various servers,
  allowing me to expose services between servers without exposing them to the
  internet as a whole.

* Eliminate the need for a webserver to generate certificates. nsupdate__ is
  an option, but it's part of BIND, and I won't want to install all of BIND
  just for that. Another alternative is ldns-update__, and seems like the best
  choice. Alternatively, there's knsupdate__, but unfortunately that's bundled
  with Knot DNS rather than being standalone.
