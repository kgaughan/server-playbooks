Playbook
========

* It would be nice to have a role for deploying an OAuth server.

* A nice to have would be a *secondary MX*.

* Add a wireguard__ role. This would give me a VPN between my various servers,
  allowing me to expose services between servers without exposing them to the
  internet as a whole.

Hosts
=====

* Ensure `site deployment`__ works properly. [Update: after some work, I got
  mirrors.talideon.com to deploy, but it needs some work regarding
  talideon.com itself. Will need some mechanism for vhost customisation and
  domains.txt customisation. Need got switch subdomains other than 'www' away
  from using a common certificate.]

* Test manann as a primary MX. [Will require certificate migration.]

Ideas for further changes
=========================

* Consider blacklistd__

* SSHFP__
