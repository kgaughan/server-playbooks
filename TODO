Playbook
========

* Configure `role dependencies`_.
* Create a 'ttrss' role based, with the 'mysql' role as a dependency.

.. _role dependencies: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies

Hosts
=====

* Ensure `site deployment <https://github.com/kgaughan/sites>`_ works properly.
* Test manann as a primary MX.
* Deploy webmail.talideon.com on eimhir as a test run of splitting my ACME and
  webserver configuration up.
* Configure a WebDAV server on manann, possibly dav.talideon.com.

Bugs
====

* The *mynetworks* list is hardwired in *roles/mailserver/templates/main.cf.j2*
