Playbook
========

* Create a 'dav' role for spinning up a WebDAV server on manann, possibly
  dav.talideon.com.

* Separate out a 'tarsnap' role.

Hosts
=====

* Ensure `site deployment <https://github.com/kgaughan/sites>`_ works properly.
* Test manann as a primary MX.

Bugs
====

* The *mynetworks* list is hardwired in *roles/mailserver/templates/main.cf.j2*
  making it difficult to keep the list of host IPs in sync.

* Deploying a new site needs an extra step with ACME. While there's a default
  vhost listening on port 80, the deployment of the vhost configuration before
  running ``/usr/local/etc/acme/acme-client.sh`` will prevent the generation of
  the certificate. The job should be run *before* the vhost config is deployed
  if the vhost config isn't already present.
