Playbook
========

* Create a 'feedreader' role that properly configures TT-RSS in single-user
  mode, creates the database, and starts the daemon.

Hosts
=====

* Ensure `site deployment <https://github.com/kgaughan/sites>`_ works properly.
* Test manann as a primary MX.
* Deploy webmail.talideon.com on eimhir as a test run of splitting my ACME and
  webserver configuration up.
* Configure a WebDAV server on manann, possibly dav.talideon.com.

Bugs
====

* The *mynetworks* list is hardwired in *roles/mailserver/templates/main.cf.j2*
  making it difficult to keep the list of host IPs in sync.
