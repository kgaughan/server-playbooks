Playbook
========

* It would be nice to have a role for deploying an OAuth server.

* A nice to have would be a *secondary MX*.

* Add a wireguard__ role. This would give me a VPN between my various servers,
  allowing me to expose services between servers without exposing them to the
  internet as a whole.

Hosts
=====

* Test manann as a primary MX. [Will require certificate migration.]

Ideas for further changes
=========================

* SSHFP__
